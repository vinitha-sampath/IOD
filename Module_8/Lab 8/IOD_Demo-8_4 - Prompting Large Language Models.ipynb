    "SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- A magnitude 4.2 earthquake shook the San Francisco area Friday at 4:42 a.m. PT (7:42 a.m. ET), the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The quake left about 2,000 customers without power, said David Eisenhower, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Light. Under the USGS classification, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake is considered \"light,\" which it says usually causes minimal damage. \"We had quite a spike in calls, mostly calls of inquiry, none of any injury, none of any damage that was reported,\" said Capt. Al Casciato of the San Francisco police. \"It was fairly mild.\" Watch police describe concerned calls immediately after the quake Â» . The quake was centered about two miles east-northeast of Oakland, at a depth of 3.6 miles, the USGS said. Oakland is just east of San Francisco, across San Francisco Bay. An Oakland police dispatcher told CNN the quake set off alarms at people's homes. The shaking lasted about 50 seconds, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. According to the USGS, magnitude 4.2 quakes are felt indoors and may break dishes and windows and overturn unstable objects. Pendulum clocks may stop.\n",

NLP involves several tasks such as speech recognition, natural language understanding, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text summarization. NLP is used in various applications such as virtual assistants, chatbots, information retrieval, and language learning. NLP is a complex field that requires a deep understanding of linguistics, computer science, and statistics. It involves processing large amounts of language data and using machine learning algorithms to extract insights and meaning from the data. NLP has numerous applications in business, education, healthcare, and entertainment, and is a rapidly growing field with many exciting developments on the horizon.\n"
